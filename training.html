		<h2>Training Packages</h2>

		<h3>Full-Time Training</h3>
		<p>Horses in fulltime training are worked by our trainers five times a week, with goals tailored to the owner.  Fulltime training includes full-board.</p>
		<h3>Part-Time Training</h3>
		<p>Horses in part-time training will be worked 3 times a week. Part-time training can be packaged with full or partial care board.</p>
		<h3>Individual Training Sessions</h3>
		<p>Individual training sessions are available for both boarders and clients who would like to haul in.  Individual training sessions are not packaged with board.</p>
