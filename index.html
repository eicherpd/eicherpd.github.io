				<h2>Logos</h2>
				<p>The topic for my research project is a dive into the visual history for some of the larger chocolate companies that we see at the grocery store.  For the sake of refining focus I chose to direct my attention towards logos, however, I will show new and old packaging examples.</p>
				<p>What is a logo? A logo is a tiny piece of graphical information that seeks to encapsulate the ethos and ideology that a brand is trying to present. Like all elements of advertising, logos are essentially dishonest – they attempt to portray a best possible vision of the underlying brand. You can’t always judge a book by its cover, but you probably will. The human mind will probably use the visual language of a product to inform its desirability and quality. Can you think of how many times you’ve bought a product just because the packaging looked nicer? In laying down a framework for logo analysis it’s important to understand the types of logos that you see. Every logo, on a macro level, falls into one of two groups.</p>

				<h3>Representational Logos</h3>

				<h3>How do we identify good design?</h3>
				<p>The question we must pose is “why do we like looking at certain things?” It’s probably based on nature. “Natural fractals — irregular, self-similar geometry — occur virtually everywhere in nature: in coastlines and riverways, in snowflakes and leaf veins, even in our own lungs. In recent years, physicists have found that people invariably prefer a certain mathematical density of fractals — not too thick, not too sparse. The theory is that this particular pattern echoes the shapes of trees, specifically the acacia, on the African savanna, the place stored in our genetic memory from the cradle of the human race.”</p>

				<h3>The cycle of design</h3>
				<p>When we look at a well-designed piece of visual information we inherently begin to associate that visual information with the ideas surrounding the brand. As we mature within this consumer society we build a mental lexicon of visual components. We use this mental lexicon as a lens through which we can quickly decipher and parse new visual information. Additionally, when we like a product we are more likely to begin to positively associate with that brand’s visual identity, even when it might be subpar. The inverse is also true. This can help us begin to understand how large brands can use visuals to sell products on a massive scale.</p>

				<p>Cadbury is a premium of a brand that continued to reinvent itself, trying to perfect the same basic idea. While the logo has changed a lot since its inception, it retains the same basic values such as elegance, always alluding to some "European" sensibility.It does this by using whispy, handrawn letterforms, attempting to negotiate between legibility and artistry.</p>

				<p>Interestingly, the Cadbury logo in 1866 used a brown background behind the letterforms, which mirrors what Hershey would continue to be doing almost a century later.</p>
				<p>The 1900 is a particularly creative example of a chocolate company logo. It sacrifices legibility for an art-nouveau design flair, integrating a chocolate tree into the logo. It's interesting that this particular logo doesn't seek to separate itself from the origins of the product.</p>

				<p>Ultimately, this packaging is a good example of an "appeal to tradition" &ndash; trying to frame itself as an authority based on the typography used, ornate decoration. This is seen in the bar design as well. It has not been revamped or overhauled at all over the past 100 years, rather; it has simply been modernized.

				<p>The Nestle identity hasn’t really evolved beyond its original form. The first logo was a seal originating from the founder – the last name Nestle literally refers to “a nest.” We can see that this has been greatly clarified since this first logo.</p><p>The contemporary Nestle brand has been a source of controversy for a multitude of reasons beyond that of their use of exploitative labor in their confectionary products. It is not hard to see, then, how it uses this logo as a buffer against criticism. Without context you could look at this and imagine how it could be used for a nonprofit – the bird forms relate almost a spiritual, religious character – the idea of a dove.</p>

			<p>Nestle’s logo makes it seem like the most honest brand in the world; the birds nest immediately relates ideas of family and goodwill and ultimately help humanize the brand, insulating it from criticism. The nest provides this idea of parental protection and helps frame the corporation as an almighty protector, offering itself a status of prestige among similar brands.</p>

				<p>The nest was not present on the traditional Nestle bar itself. The bar consistently utilized this bright red motif, which contrasts against their corporate desaturated blue. While the Nestle milk chocolate bar was discontinued in 2016, this design can be seen on current European Kit Kat bars.</p>

				<p>All of this is extremely ironic, considering Nestle’s current status. It is, however, unsurprising that they would want to present themselves this way. It’s a good example of corporations using their visual identity as a buffer against criticism.</p>

				<p>The product is the logo. When you think of a Hershey product, you probably imagine the classic milk chocolate bar. This bar is the logo; as a result, it has inherent depth and dimensionality to it, which allows consumers to imprint more meaning onto it. Hershey has the largest market share for chocolate in the United States by a pretty significant margin – the only major competitor is Mars, which has two-thirds of what Hershey has. This makes Hershey a ubiquitous “American” brand. For better or worse, it has been ingrained into our culture and as a result consumers trust Hershey.</p>
				<p>I think Hershey chocolate is a good counterargument to the concept of chocolate as an exclusive luxury good. By keeping the price low they have been able to provide this universal, indulgent, transcendent experience regardless of economic status. That is; the ubiquity of Hershey’s chocolate has allowed it to become a connecting factor among a diverse population. </p>

			<p>They shifted away from decorative in the early 20th century, and after arriving at something that resembles the current design both the Hershey’s logo and the Hershey’s milk chocolate bar have not really changed in over 100 years. Hershey’s identity has changed some in the past few years, and this is probably because they needed to make considerations for a changing market. Brands no longer just exist physically in stores, rather; they need to market themselves effectively in the vacuum of the digital marketplace.</p>

				<p>Since shifting away from the decorative styling of the early milk chocolate bar designs, the bar has functioned as an extremely effective billboard for the brand itself.</p>
				<p>Its (well, mostly) unchanging presence has allowed it to play to ideas of “childhood love” and nostalgia. As a result, Hershey’s has managed to make itself a permanent fixture in American life.</p>

				<h3>Why Does This Matter?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="col-12">
				
				<p>We know that visuals influence consumer behavior. Part of the reason that major corporations can hold on to market share is because they have the capital to dominate the visual marketplace. Within the realm of chocolate this is especially important. Sources estimate that anywhere from 60-90% of chocolate sales exist as impulse purchases. </p><p>The problem with design is that it works. These companies have been able to leverage their resources against anything that disparages them, and we (society) still trust them. Who could view a childhood symbol of love as anything other than that? How can we reverse that programming?</p>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="col-12">
				
				<p>None of these brands have really evolved significantly in their long history. They’ve used their visual identity to build a heritage brand that invokes trust and honesty in the mind of a consumer. As a result, it’s not hard to see why they have not been held accountable and why it is and will be so difficult to change how they are viewed in the minds of the consumer. </p><p>The fact that these brands haven’t changed much visually since their inception allows them to be intergenerational connectors. This also allows them to play to nostalgia, which in turn helps them build that sense of trust and integrity.</p>
