The process for this project was two-pronged, with a photographic and typographic component. The priority was conveying the idea of 'light' through photography, which was done using long exposure photography with some manual manipulation. The typography was composed in a way that reflected both the overall aesthetic of the album and the aesthetic of the photography.</p></div><div class="flex-item rectangle"><img src="image/inside.jpg" alt="image of the talking heads cd redesign back"></div></div>
